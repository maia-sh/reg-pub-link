This repository contains code for the project "Results publications are inadequately linked to trial registrations: An automated pipeline and evaluation of German university medical centers." The manuscript is computationally reproducible using this repository. Note that a few manual formatting tweaks to tables and figures were done for the final [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.23.21262478).

To reproduce the manuscript:

1.  Clone this repository
2.  Run `renv::restore()` to ensure you have the necessary packages and versions
3.  Knit [manuscript.Rmd](https://github.com/maia-sh/reg-pub-link/blob/master/docs/manuscript/manuscript.Rmd)

This project uses `r r_citations`.
