# Get clinicaltrials.gov data via https://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/
# aact is a relational database of clinicaltrials.gov
# some variables of interest (such as registration_date and completion_date) not in intovalue
# also fetch additional ids and publications
# also fetch other dates since possibly changed and for intovalue 1/2 parity
# do no re-fetch variables that are either less likely to change or unclear how to clean like intovalue, e.g.: allocation (shouldn't change), main_sponsor (unclear source), is_multicentric (unclear source), lead_cities (unclear source and lots of intovalue munging)
