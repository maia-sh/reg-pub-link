  abstract = {Objectives Timely and comprehensive reporting of clinical trial results builds the backbone of evidence-based medicine and responsible research. The proportion of timely disseminated trial results can inform alternative national and international benchmarking of university medical centers (UMCs). Study Design and Setting For all German UMCs, we tracked all registered trials completed between 2009 and 2013. The results and an interactive website benchmark German UMCs regarding their performance in result dissemination. Results We identified and tracked 2,132 clinical trials. For 1,509 trials, one of the German UMCs took the academic lead. Of these 1,509 ``lead trials,'' 39\% published their results (mostly via journal publications) in a timely manner ({$<$}24~months after completion). More than 6~years after study completion, 26\% of all eligible lead trials still had not disseminated results. Conclusion Despite substantial attention from many stakeholders to the topic, there is still a strong delay or even absence of result dissemination for many trials. German UMCs have several opportunities to improve this situation. Further research should evaluate whether and how a transparent benchmarking of UMC performance in result dissemination helps to increase value and reduce waste in medical research.},

  abstract = {Objective: The Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews contains search filters to find randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in Ovid MEDLINE: one maximizing sensitivity and another balancing sensitivity and precision. These filters were originally published in 1994 and were adapted and updated in 2008. To determine the performance of these filters, the authors tested them and thirty-six other MEDLINE filters against a large new gold standard set of relevant records.Methods: We identified a gold standard set of RCT reports published in 2016 from the Cochrane CENTRAL database of controlled clinical trials. We retrieved the records in Ovid MEDLINE and combined these with each RCT filter. We calculated their sensitivity, relative precision, and f-scores.Results: The gold standard comprised 27,617 records. MEDLINE searches were run on July 16, 2019. The most sensitive RCT filter was Duggan et al. (sensitivity=0.99). The Cochrane sensitivity-maximizing RCT filter had a sensitivity of 0.96 but was more precise than Duggan et al. (0.14 compared to 0.04 for Duggan). The most precise RCT filters had 0.97 relative precision and 0.83 sensitivity.Conclusions: The Cochrane Ovid MEDLINE sensitivity-maximizing RCT filter can continue to be used by Cochrane reviewers and to populate CENTRAL, as it has very high sensitivity and a slightly better precision relative to more sensitive filters. The results of this study, which used a very large gold standard to compare the performance of all known RCT filters, allows searchers to make better informed decisions about which filters to use for their work.},

The largest source of metadata that describes the experimental protocol, funding, and scientific leadership of clinical studies is ClinicalTrials.gov. We evaluated whether values in 302,091 trial records adhere to expected data types and use terms from biomedical ontologies, whether records contain fields required by government regulations, and whether structured elements could replace free-text elements. Contact information, outcome measures, and study design are frequently missing or underspecified. Important fields for search, such as condition and intervention, are not restricted to ontologies, and almost half of the conditions are not denoted by MeSH terms, as recommended. Eligibility criteria are stored as semi-structured free text. Enforcing the presence of all required elements, requiring values for certain fields to be drawn from ontologies, and creating a structured eligibility criteria element would improve the reusability of data from ClinicalTrials.gov in systematic reviews, metanalyses, and matching of eligible patients to trials.},

Reports of clinical research are important to many groups, especially other researchers, clinicians, systematic reviewers, and patients. Nonpublication of the findings of some research studies, either through suppression of complete studies or selective reporting within publications, always diminishes the evidence base. Inadequate reporting of methodology can also seriously impede assessment of the reliability of published articles. Reporting guidelines provide structured advice on the minimum information to be included in an article reporting a particular type of health research. Journals have a key role in helping to improve the literature by requiring the full and transparent reporting of research.

  abstract = {The IntoValue dataset contains clinical trials conducted at one of 35 German UMCs and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov or the German Clinical Trials Registry (DRKS). All trials were reported as complete between 2009 and 2017 on the trial registry at the time of data collection. The dataset also includes a results publication found via manual searches; if multiple results publications were found, the earliest was included. Trials were associated with a German UMC by searching for trials with a UMC listed as responsible party or lead sponsor, or with a principle investigator (PI) from a UMC ('lead\_city'). Version 1 additionally includes trials with a UMC only as a facility (`facility\_city`). A lookup table of regular expressions used to identify German UMCs is available at https://github.com/quest-bih/IntoValue2/blob/master/data/1\_sample\_generation/city\_search\_terms.csv. Trials include all interventional studies and are not limited to investigational medical product trials, as regulated by the EU's Clinical Trials Directive or Germany's Arzneimittelgesetz (AMG) or Novelle des Medizinproduktegesetzes (MPG). DRKS data were searched and downloaded as CSVs from the DRKS website (https://www.drks.de/). ClinicalTrials.gov data were downloaded as CSVs from Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) Aggregate Content of ClinicalTrials.gov (AACT) (https://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/). DRKS and ClinicalTrials.gov use different terminology for various trial aspects, such as phase and masking; these different levels are captured in the data dictionary as `levels\_drks` and `levels\_ctgov`. For later analyses requiring parity across registries, levels for some variables were collapsed and a lookup table is provided in `iv\_data\_lookup\_registries.csv`. These data were generated and used for two publications (Wieschowski et al., 2019; Riedel et al. 2021) and therefore comprises two versions (indicated as `iv\_version`). For version 1, registry data was collected on April 17, 2017 from ClinicalTrials.gov and on July 27, 2017 for DRKS and was limited to trials with a completion date on DRKS and primary completion date on ClinicalTrials.gov between 2009 and 2013. Version 1 manual searches for results publications were conducted from 2017-07-01 to 2017-12-01. For version 2, registry data was collected on June 3, 2020 and was limited to trials with a completion date on DRKS and ClinicalTrials.gov between 2014 and 2017. Version 2 manual searches for results publications were conducted from 2020-07-01 to 2020-09-01. Publication identifiers (DOI, PMID, URL) were manually entered during the publication search and then further enhanced using the API of Internet Archive's open-source Fatcat catalog of research publications, to add PMIDs based on DOIs, and vice versa. Manual search steps differed slightly in the two versions and are indicated and described in `identification\_step`. Version 1 includes trials with a German UMC as either a `lead\_city` or a `facility\_city`, whereas version 2 is limited to trials a German UMC as a `lead\_city`. Each row indicates a single trial registration. Due to changes in completion dates, some trials are duplicated between versions as indicated in `is\_dupe`. Cross-registered trials were manually deduplicated, and some cross-registered duplicates remain (e.g., DRKS00004156 and NCT00215683) and are not indicated in the dataset. All dates are provided as `yyyy-mm-dd`. Additional documentation on each variable (type, description, levels) is provided in `iv\_data\_dictionary.csv`. Additional information on the project and methods for generating the dataset is available in associated publications and at the project's OSF page (https://osf.io/98j7u/).

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}The methods and results of health research are documented in study protocols, full study reports (detailing all analyses), journal reports, and participant-level datasets. However, protocols, full study reports, and participant-level datasets are rarely available, and journal reports are available for only half of all studies and are plagued by selective reporting of methods and results. Furthermore, information provided in study protocols and reports varies in quality and is often incomplete. When full information about studies is inaccessible, billions of dollars in investment are wasted, bias is introduced, and research and care of patients are detrimentally affected. To help to improve this situation at a systemic level, three main actions are warranted. First, academic institutions and funders should reward investigators who fully disseminate their research protocols, reports, and participant-level datasets. Second, standards for the content of protocols and full study reports and for data sharing practices should be rigorously developed and adopted for all types of health research. Finally, journals, funders, sponsors, research ethics committees, regulators, and legislators should endorse and enforce policies supporting study registration and wide availability of journal reports, full study reports, and participant-level datasets.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Objective: Timely publication of clinical trial results is central for evidence-based medicine. The performance of university medical centers (UMCs) regarding timely results publication informs the local and national decision makers, patients, and the public about the need to improve trial results dissemination. Study Design and Setting: Following the same search and tracking methods used in our previous study for the years 2009 - 2013, we identified trials lead by German UMCs completed between 2014 and 2017 and tracked results dissemination for the identified trials. Results: We identified 1,658 trials in the 2014-2017 cohort. Of these trials, 43\% published results as either journal publication or summary results within 24 months after completion date, which is an improvement of 3.8\% percentage points compared to the previous study. At the UMC level, the 24-month publication rates varied from 14\% to 71\%. Five years after completion, still 30\% of the trials remained unpublished. Conclusion: Despite minor improvements compared to the previously investigated cohort, the rate of timely reporting of trials lead by German UMCs remains low. German UMCs should take further steps to improve timely reporting rates.},

  abstract = {Background It is an ethical and scientific obligation to register each clinical trial, and report its results, accurately, comprehensively and on time. The WHO recognizes 17 public registries as Primary Registries, and has also introduced a set of minimal standards in the International Standards for Clinical Trial Registries (ISCTR) that primary registries need to implement. These standards are categorized into nine sections\textemdash Content, Quality and Validity, Accessibility, Unambiguous Identification, Technical Capacity, Administration and Governance, the Trial Registration Data Set (TRDS), Partner registries and Data Interchange Standards. This study compared the WHO's primary registries, and the US's ClinicalTrials.gov, to examine the implementation of ISCTR, with the aim of defining features of an interim ideal registry. Methods and findings The websites of the 18 registries were evaluated for 14 features that map to one or more of the nine sections of ISCTR, and assigned scores for their variations of these features. The assessed features include the nature of the content; the number and nature of fields to conduct a search; data download formats; the nature of the audit trail; the health condition category; the documentation available on a registry website; etc. The registries received scores for their particular variation of a given feature based on a scoring rationale devised for each individual feature analysed. Overall, the registries received between 27\% and 80\% of the maximum score of 94. The results from our analysis were used to define a set of features of an interim ideal registry. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the widely divergent quality of the primary registries' compliance with the ISCTR. Even with this limited assessment, it is clear that some of the registries have much work to do, although even a few improvements would significantly improve them.},
